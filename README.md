# 🧩 Matt Parker's 5-Word Alphabet Challenge

Inspired by Matt Parker’s brilliant linguistic puzzle, this repository explores the challenge of finding **five English words** that together use **25 unique letters** — meaning they collectively contain every letter of the alphabet **except one**.

## 🎯 The Goal

To discover or generate sets of **five valid English words** that:
- Use a total of **25 different letters**
- Contain **no repeated letters across the words**
- Miss **exactly one letter** from the English alphabet (A–Z)

This is also known as the "**Pangram Minus One**" challenge.

## 📝 Example

Here’s an example 5-word set that uses 25 unique letters, missing only **Q**:

```
fjord
blanket
chimp
vex
swag
```

Letters used: All except **Q**

## 🧠 Why?

This is a fun test of:
- Vocabulary and word structure
- Letter distribution in English
- Creative problem-solving!

It also touches on combinatorics and algorithmic generation — a great excuse to explore code and linguistics.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repo
